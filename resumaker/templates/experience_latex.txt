# Instruction 3 (Final):
When writing latex code be careful to keep the forward slash counts precisely the same as I have written them. You have a tendency to make extra forward slashes for instance "◊◊" then "◊" is sufficient, ruining the latex code. For instance I wrote "◊href" and you'll repeat it back as "◊◊href" ruining all compilation in latex. Be sure that when you're using a specific experience from the JSON Experience object that you're also filling in all the necessary fields, using all three "◊item" points that are listed in the JSON object for each individual experience. Again, be very careful not to make stuff up that I did, instead of saying “demonstrated proficiency {SKILL_FROM_JOB_DESCRIPTION} {TOOL_FROM_JOB_DESCRIPTION}” that I never historically demonstrated experience in (since it's not in the JSON Experience object), instead say “demonstrated proficiency in {SKILL_FROM_JSON_EXPERIENCE} {TOOL_FROM_JSON_EXPERIENCE} which is similar to {SKILL_FROM_JOB_DESCRIPTION} {TOOL_FROM_JOB_DESCRIPTION}”. Also, please fill in the undefined variables for both volunteer experiences under the “VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE” section relating it to the job description. Please just provide the completed LaTeX code below:
