Dear hiring manager at {THE_COMPANY},

I am excited to apply for the {JOB_TITLE} position at {THE_COMPANY}!

Allow me to share a relevant project from my time at HomeOptions. I developed a predictive model for forecasting homeowner foreclosures within a year of purchase. Despite limited direction and resources, I delivered a web interface for our non-technical sales team to interact with the model, demonstrating my ability to thrive in autonomous and ambiguous environments.

I mastered SageMaker and XGBoost through Udemy courses and AWS tutorials. I created a SageMaker notebook instance, configured user permissions, and documented the entire process. I also negotiated with data brokers to acquire necessary datasets within a tight budget.

I enhanced the model’s performance by cleaning and preprocessing data, training the XGBoost model using AWS SageMaker, and employing SMOTE to balance the dataset. Through feature selection with RFE and integration via Lambda and API Gateway, I ensured the model was accessible through a user-friendly web interface. My optimization efforts improved the model's F1-score by 15% with geographic data.

This project honed my technical skills and showcased my adaptability, resourcefulness, and effective communication. I am confident my track record of navigating complex challenges and delivering impactful solutions will add value to {THE_COMPANY}.

I noticed {THE_COMPANY} uses {JOB_TOOL_1} and {JOB_TOOL_2}, which are similar to the AWS and SageMaker tools I mastered. My expertise with XGBoost and SMOTE aligns with your requirements for {RELATED_JOB_SKILL}.

I am particularly drawn to {THE_COMPANY} because of your commitment to {COMPANY_VALUE}. Your focus on {COMPANY_FOCUS} resonates with my dedication to {RELATED_FIELD}.

My wife, our daughter, and I have moved to the Takapuna area of Auckland after graduating from Portland State University in June. Our immigration advisor, Charlotte Stockman from NZ Shores, has handled all paperwork and fees. We just need a job offer to complete the process.
