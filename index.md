## Welcome to Bridgeworx Games

Our mission is to build tools that help people build bridges. Our ultimate goal is develop couch co-op games that build memories and relationships. Currently, our only completed project is Farmyard Feeder.

I keep wanting to say "our" but it's honestly just myself. I have big aspirations though! I'm a full time student at Portland State University studying Computer Science. I'm only in my second year of higher education, and it's challenging yet rewarding. I'm also a dad and a husband. I made Farmyard Feeder for my daughter during the spring break to bring some relief for her during this whole COVID-19 "stay home, save lives" executive order. If you have some friends with children who would play this simple game, please tell them about it. It helps me make more games.
