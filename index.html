            <h2>ADAPTABILITY & EMPATHY</h2>
            <p>
              Having been the "new guy" many times throughout my diverse career
              path, I understand the importance of aroha (compassion) and
              creating a welcoming environment in the classroom. My Ukrainian
              wife, our daughter, and I have relocated multiple times, most
              recently to Aotearoa from America, a move which has deepened my
              appreciation for diverse perspectives. My multicultural background
              helps me connect with students and foster an inclusive classroom
              where everyone feels valued and their unique perspectives are
              seen. I am committed to honoring the histories, heritages,
              languages, and cultures of partners to the Te Tiriti o Waitangi by
              practicing and developing my understanding of te reo and tikanga
              Māori.
