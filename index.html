            <h2>ADAPTABILITY & EMPATHY</h2>
            <p>
              Having been the "new guy" many times throughout my diverse career
              path, I understand the importance of aroha (compassion) and
              creating a welcoming environment in the classroom. My Ukrainian
              wife, our daughter, and I have relocated multiple times, most
              recently to Aotearoa from America, a move which has deepened my
              appreciation for diverse perspectives. My multicultural background
              helps me connect with students and foster an inclusive classroom
              where everyone feels valued and their unique perspectives are
              seen. I am committed to honoring the histories, heritages,
              languages, and cultures of partners to the Te Tiriti o Waitangi by
              practicing and developing my understanding of te reo and tikanga
              Māori.

            <h2>TENACITY & LIFELONG LEARNING</h2>
            <p>
              I’m naturally curious and always look for ways to improve, both
              for myself and my students. I never give up on kaupapa (important
              matters) and always find new ways to explain concepts. I’d also
              love to support extracurricular activities like chess clubs,
              robotics, or rock climbing, as these align with my passion for
              helping students build māia (confidence) and explore their
              interests outside of class. My goal is to help students build
              strong portfolios and prepare for their next steps, whether that's
              university or the workforce, by equipping them with the skills and
              manawaroa (resilience) they need. Maintaining ngākau pono
              (integrity) is at the core of my approach, but I also believe in
              keeping things lighthearted and creating a positive, fun
              atmosphere where students feel encouraged to take on challenges.
            </p>
            <h2>BALANCED MINDSET</h2>
            <p>
              Physical fitness and hobbies like rock climbing, hiking, and
              weight-lifting keep me energized and mentally sharp, while healthy
              self-doubt keeps me grounded and open to growth. I strive to model
              tūāpapa (a strong foundation) and balance for my students,
              ensuring I stay adaptable and approachable in supporting their
              learning and personal growth. By embracing my role as an ākonga
              (learner), I demonstrate that learning is a lifelong journey, one
              that I approach with enthusiasm and a sense of fun to create a
              classroom environment where learning feels exciting and engaging.
